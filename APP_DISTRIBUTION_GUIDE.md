### Method 1: Simple Folder Distribution (Recommended)

**Files to distribute:**
```

**Location:** `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\`

**How to distribute:**
1. ✅ Copy the entire `Release` folder
2. ✅ Rename it to `TrackKaro_Desktop_App`
3. ✅ Zip the folder

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What clients might see:

**Windows Security Warning:**
```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
```

**Solution for clients:**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. App will start normally

**To prevent this warning:**
- Get a code signing certificate
- Sign your executable before distribution

### Antivirus Software:
- Some antivirus software may flag unsigned executables
- Clients may need to add exception for the app folder
- Code signing eliminates most false positives

- Create FAQ document for common issues
- Test on different Windows versions before release

### Releasing Updates:
1. Build new release version
2. Test thoroughly
3. Increment version number in app
